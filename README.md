# When Goblins Attack

This is a small game prototype I'm putting together using Unity to scrub up my game development skills.

There's no really concrete direction that it's going in, but the overall idea is to defend against waves of goblins (and potentially other enemies) with your band of mercenaries.

I'd like it to have light strategic elements based around positioning and bottlenecking of your enemies in order to fight off overwhelming numbers.
